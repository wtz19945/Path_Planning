1. New MPC formulation
2. Trapezoidal integration with varying integration time
3. Add Cost on foot change for smoother trajectory
4. Add swing foot trajectory and avoidance
5. decomposition of avoidance in xy-plane and z-plane
6. Formulate the QP as an Mixed Integer Programming
7. This MPC predicts more steps
8. Add a distance feedback
